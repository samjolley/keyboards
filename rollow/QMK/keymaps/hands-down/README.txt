Transition to Miryoku

Layers:
HANDS_DOWN (Gold)- Default base layer
QWERTY 			 - Optional base layer
LOWER (layer 3)  - Symbols
RAISE (layer 4)  - Navigation and some symbols
ADJUST (layer 5) - Numbers

To Do:
Adjust keymap for the reduced layout. Use Miryoku (https://caksoylar-keymap-drawer-streamlitapp-2a0rau.streamlit.app/?example_yaml=miryoku.yaml), hands down server peeps
Tweak combos
Emoji shorcuts?!
Linger keys? Slight hold on Q = "qu" or Tap Dance
Run my common typed material through a stats program to learn most commonly used symbols and punctuation. Adjust as needed to place most commonly used punctuation near strong fingers. Limit pinky usage. 
Try out moving backspace to a layer
