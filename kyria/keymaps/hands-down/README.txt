Took much inspiration from the default kyria keymap.c, Thomas Baart, and the moutis HandsDown info with this one. Also lots of great help from the QMK, SplitKB, and Hands Down discord users!

Layers:
HANDS_DOWN (Gold)- Default base layer
QWERTY 			 - Optional base layer
LOWER (layer 3)  - Symbols
RAISE (layer 4)  - Navigation and some symbols
ADJUST (layer 5) - Numbers

To Do:
Emoji shorcuts?!
Linger keys? Slight hold on Q = "qu" or Tap Dance
Run my common typed material through a stats program to learn most commonly used symbols and punctuation. Adjust as needed to place most commonly used punctuation near strong fingers. Limit pinky usage.
