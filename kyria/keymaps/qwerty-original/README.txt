QWERTY, LOWER, RAISE, and ADJUST layers, plus a NORMAN layer with a dedicated toggle key.

Layer 4 (NORMAN) toggle on right-side top-left thumb key. 
DF 0 and DF 4 keys on adjust layer QWERTY letter J and M.

Took much inspiration from the default keymap.c and Thomas Baart's version with this one.

To Do:
Remove unused mousekeys
Consider alternative layout like Hands Down
Emoji shorcuts?!
Linger keys? Slight hold on Q = "qu"
